<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, how is your morning, afternoon, or evening? But whatever time of the day you have visited me, I would like to extend a warm welcome and a friendly smile to you; my name is Anil Gilbert, 
  and you are about to learn a little bit about me; thanks for listening;</p>
<p> I am from an island in the U.S.A it’s a small island with lots of people who come from all over the world to live and visit. 
  Can you guess? Yes, that is correct; N.Y.C. Brooklyn N.Y is where I was born and raised; I grew up loving to rollerblade; I enjoy museums, broadway shows, opera, dancing, food, fashion, and art; 
  I love people too, I think that people are the most beautiful creatures that were created because they come from all walks of life and 
  bring a unique perspective experience to the world. 
  We can learn so much from each other.</p>
 
<p>That is why I will be forever a lifelong learner; currently, I am learning web development, and I want to become a frontend developer and then eventually a full-stack developer; 
  finally would like to land a job in this field. So if you would like to talk about web development or anything about programming; let’s communicate and sharpen each other;
  I would love to connect; but that is all about me at this time; let’s connect so I can learn about you; </p>
